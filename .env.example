# Local path where the device-type library repository is cloned.

# SSL options — choose one approach if your NetBox uses a self-signed or private CA:
#
#   Option A (recommended): point requests at your CA bundle so the certificate
#   is validated properly.  Set REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE to the path of your PEM-encoded
#   CA certificate or bundle file.  This is a standard requests/urllib3 variable
#   and is also respected by most Python HTTP clients.
# REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/my-internal-ca.pem
#
#   Option B (insecure – dev/test only): disable certificate verification entirely.
#   IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=False is the secure default; set to True only for local/dev use.
#   WARNING: This bypasses all certificate validation and exposes connections to
#   man-in-the-middle attacks.  Never enable in production environments.
IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=False

# Optional: restrict import to specific device type slugs

# Performance tuning — adjust for your NetBox instance size and network
# Number of items per GraphQL page (default: 5000).
# Values up to 25000 have been tested successfully on a default NetBox
# instance with minimal extra latency.  Most NetBox installs cap
# MAX_PAGE_SIZE at 1000 by default; the client detects server-side
# clamping and paginates accordingly.
#GRAPHQL_PAGE_SIZE=5000

# Number of threads for concurrent component preloading (default: 8).
# Reduce on smaller instances to lower load; increase for faster imports.
#PRELOAD_THREADS=8
